# LaradockAPI - Laravel 11 API with Docker

LaradockAPI is an API built with Laravel 11, optimized for deployment in a Docker environment. This project includes a Docker container configuration for PHP, Nginx, MySQL, Redis, and PhpMyAdmin. Automated test scripts (linter, PHPStan, unit tests) are also integrated to ensure code quality and stability.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** must be installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StephaneKuma/laradockapi.git
   cd laradockapi

2. Copy the .env.example file to .env and configure environment variables if necessary:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env

3. Start the containers with Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build

4. Install Laravel dependencies inside the PHP container:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec app composer install

5. Generate the application key:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate

6. Run migrations to create the database tables:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec app php artisan migrate


## Service Access

- Laravel API: [http://api.localhost](http://api.localhost/)
- PhpMyAdmin: [http://pma.localhost](http://pma.localhost/) (MySQL database access)
- Mailhog: [http://mail.localhost](http://mail.localhost/) (for mail testing, without the port)
